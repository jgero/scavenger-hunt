# jgero.me webpage

This project is composed of multiple pages for the main domain and multiple subdomains. All these pages are built with Svelte and Sapper and deployed to cloud run in the google cloud.

## develop, build and run

The [Makefile](https://github.com/jgero/my-webpage/blob/main/Makefile) contains separate rules to build and run development and production versions of the pages. By setting the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` environment variable it is possible to specify a container runtime. The rules were tested for podman and docker, so one of these is recommended. Defaults to docker.

With the rules `main`, `portfolio` and `space` development servers for the respective webpages are started. The `build` rule builds production versions of all the pages, with `PAGENAME_build_prod` a specific production image is built. There are also the rules `push` and `deploy` which push and deploy the images to gcp, but these are not meant to be run manually, only in CI by the cloudbuild.
